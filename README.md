* The markets reflect rational behavior or human irrationality? Mass psychology's effects may not be the only factor driving the markets, but itâ€™s unquestionably significant.
* This fascinating quality is something that we can measure and use to predict market movement with surprising accuracy levels.
With the real-time information available to us on massive information in newspaper like Times of Inadia and Deccan Haeralad, we have all the data we could ever need to create these predictions.
* But then comes the question, how can our computer understand what this unstructured text data means?
* That is where sentiment analysis comes in. Sentiment analysis is a particularly interesting branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is used to rate the language used in a body of text.
* Through sentiment analysis, we can take thousands of tweets about a company and judge whether they are generally positive or negative (the sentiment) in real-time!
